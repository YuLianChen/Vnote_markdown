## Background

I developed a Google Chrome extension [ExportGPT](https://chatopenai.pro/exportgpt/) before, which supports one-click export of the current conversation record to multiple formats.

Especially exporting to Markdown format is the most popular. But I don’t just want to export ChatGPT conversations, I want to support the export of all blog sites, especially when I see excellent articles on medium or dev.to, I want to export them locally.

So I searched for a Google extension Markdownload, which is excellent and supports almost all websites, but the details are not handled well enough. For example, github remote code snippets may be inserted in medium, which cannot be parsed.

Including the processing of the author card in dev.to, it is not detailed enough. So for these details, I wrote a Google extension that exports web pages as Markdown – Web2Markdown.

## Introduction

You can convert the content of the current page into Markdown format with just a click while browsing. This conversion retains the text, headings, links, images, and other elements of the web page, enabling you to save and share website content in a concise and readable manner.

It supports almost all blog sites. Most websites will use a common parsing method, but some websites must be specially processed to export normal Markdown text. For example the following sites

1. chat.openai.com
2. medium.com
3. dev.to
4. zhuanlan.zhihu.com

## Installation

If you have already installed it, please make sure you have updated to the latest version.
